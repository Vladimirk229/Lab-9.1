Application has three components. The first one is AlertBox which shows a message, the content of which depends on user's actions. The second component is UserProfileCard which shows some information about user. You can use this component by clicking "Edit profile". AlertBox shows message after that but you can add other actions for UserProfileCard in the code. The third component is ProductDisplay which is similar to UserProfileCard but shows information about product and after clicking the button it "adds" a new "item" to the list.
